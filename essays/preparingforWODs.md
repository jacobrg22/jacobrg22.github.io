Since my last post, I have completed two WODS: BrowserHistory6 and Invoice1.

For BrowserHistory6, I built upon the previous BrowserHistory WODs and transformed my webpage into a dynamic one. Before starting, I reviewed the readings, and I found them to be very helpful (the reading covering DOMs was particuarly helpful). However, even with this knowledge, this WOD took the most attempts to get right (6 times) out of all of the WODs that I have done so far. Though I was able to understand how  to accomplish the tasks set out by the WOD, I ran into a lot of errors with the JavaScript attribute values. In particular, I had trouble with getting the quotations right. I also had some minor issues with using innerHTML to affect the imgbox, which tied into messing up the order/placement of some quotations. Before the third attempt, I had to refer to the sample video at the end of the specifications list and compare the code to see where I was making errors. I ended up succeed on the fourth try was but decided to try it out two more times in order to complete it under 20 minutes.

Invoice1 was easier then BrowserHistory1. Though I started from scratch as opposed to building upon past WODS (like for the BrowserHistory WODS), I still had experience gained from the past WODS and I also prepared a lot more. In comparison to the past WOD, I practiced by messing around in VS code and on W3 schools and tried to see if I could make tables (which was a huge component of this WOD) in addition to what I had been doing before (reading the material). I went through it once on my own without too much trouble following the specifications and tasks outlined on the website (it certainly helped that we touched upon tables in the Lab), but I took over 40 minutes to try everything out. I watched the video and realized that I could take the example table and use its structure as a basis for modification, improving upon my previous method of manually typing all of the code for the entire table. Even though I created a template for the variables variables and rows of the table, I still had to replace the values for each one (e.g. var item1 -> var item2), which was time-consuming but not too difficult. For this WOD, I will be definitely looking into shortcuts and other ways to increase the overall efficiency of my WODs and reduce the time spent trying to replace the numbers for the variables.
