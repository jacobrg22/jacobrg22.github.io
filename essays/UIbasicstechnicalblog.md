I attempted to complete the BrowserHistory1 WOD based on the concepts I read up on and the knowledge I possessed. I failed. The most immediate problem was establishing the <!DOCTYPE> of the document. This was solved by using an emmet typeface, and I went through the steps of the WOD without much issue until I reached the point where we had to create a table of contents and list. I could not figure out the proper tags and formatting of this portion, so I scrapped my first attempt and referred to the video provided for help. After watching the video, I was able to develop a webpage with a table of contents, however, I took over the 25 minutes I was aiming for and so started my third attempt in order to reduce my time for the activity. On my third attempt, I was able to bring the time to just under 15 minutes.

As I progressed onto the next WOD, I was able to build off of my previous knowledge. In examining the code, I also found very minor errors in my previous code that I was able to clean up or fix. BrowserHistory 2 did not give me too much trouble and it only took me two tries. Though I was able to make the changes asked of me in the steps for the first attempt, I took over 10 minutes, and I also decided to watch the video to see if there were any more efficient ways to complete the WOD. Watching the video confirmed that I was on the right track, and it also showed me (in hindsight) obvious shortcuts like copy and pasting certain lines to increase efficiency. On my second attempt, I completed the exercise in under 10 minutes.

For BrowserHistory3, I tried to add the changes requested in the style.css file but I did not know all of the tags and so I referred to the video for help before starting over. On my next attempts, I went through the whole process without much issue but the site was not reflecting any of my changes. I cross-referenced my code with that of Prof. Johnson, but could not find any discrepancies between his code and my code. I thought that I was missing something obvious: maybe I did not save? Ultimately, I found out that my browser was saving a cache of the page, and as a result, my webpage was not updating, which is why this WOD took me the most attempts (4 attempts in total). 

Sometimes you know you messed up, but you don't know where you messed up. In such times, it would probably help to just start all over. I noticed that most of my problems could be solved through the acquisition of new knowledge and shortcuts as well as through searching up issues I was having on the internet. The most infuriating issue I had was on BrowserHistory3, which did not reflect any changes or updates I made to the code. It was a relatively simple issue of not clearing the cache, which I would not have known about if I did not look it up.
