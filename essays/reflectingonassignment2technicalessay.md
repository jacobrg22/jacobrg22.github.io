**Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details.**
For Assignment2, we had to. I built upon the framework I had established in Assignment1, and developed the server to make use of POST. I used query string to keep the information inputted between pages and set up a login and registration system for my website.

**What did you learn from this assignment?**
I learned a lot, not all of it relating to code. I learned how to be more efficient in my coding (shortcuts, and macros), and I learned that there is no shame in asking for helping. my issues were not necessarily erlated to the fundamentals of code, but rather how

**Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).**
I did not work with a partner, but I did ask my classmate, Noah Kim for help on the login and registration validation.

**How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?**
I had trouble making the functions for processing login and registration. After extensive experimentation, I decided to ask my classmate, Noah Kim, for help. He provided guidance on the functions and gave me the information I needed. The part that I struggled with most with was setting up the validation (character limit/character restrictions/format).

**How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?**
Developing this assignment was more "intense" than Assigment1. By this, I mean that I had to really think about how I would accomplish my tasks. Since I decided to handle a lot of validation, as well as the login/registration system on the server, I had to spend a to of time debugging the code (as I was adding a fair bit).

**Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging**
a) I estimate that I spent about 5 hours thinking about how on earth I was to accomplish something.
b) I spent maybe 5 solid hours on coding
c) I spent approximately 10 hours debugging and trying to fix my web application.

**Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?**
For this project

**If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?**

If I could go back in time and do things differently, I would not wait as long to ask for help. The time that I spent trying to figure out something on my own was valuable, but it also made me more stressed. When I used additional resources like w3 or a classmate, it was like a veil and lifted, and I could see clearly.
