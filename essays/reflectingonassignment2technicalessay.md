**Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details.**

For Assignment2, I had update my website that I worked on for Assignment1 by setting up a login and registration system, and a providing a personalized experience for users (see further details: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html, https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2_retrospective.html). 

To this end, I built upon the framework I had established in Assignment1, and developed the server to make use of POST. I used query string to keep the information inputted between pages and set up a login and registration system for my website. See the code for my Assignment here: https://github.com/jacobrg22/ITM352_S21_repo/tree/main/Graham_Jacob_Assignment2.

**What did you learn from this assignment?**

I learned a lot, though not all of it relating to programming. I learned how to be more efficient in my coding (shortcuts, and macros), which I beleive will be valuable for my Assignment3. I had an idea of how to use the query string from our in-class labs, but I did not fully realize its application until I tried it out (p+messing around with code and experimenting). I learned that a query string is probalby not the most ideal way to kepe track of information, as it is hard to keep track of all the information across the pages code-wise. Importantly, I learned that there is no shame in asking for help. Whether this helps manifests through online resources liek w3 or classmates, they can sometiems give you that little push to help you over that hurdle you've been stuck on for the past few hours or so.

**Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).**

I did not work with a partner, but I did ask my classmate, Noah Kim for help on the processing of the login and registration forms.

**How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?**

I had trouble making the functions for processing login and registration. After extensive experimentation, I decided to ask my classmate, Noah Kim, for help. He provided some guidance on the functions and gave me the ideas I needed to set up the /process_login and /process_registration on my server. I perhaps struggled the most with setting up the validation (character limit/character restrictions/format).

**How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?**

Developing this assignment was more "intense" than Assigment1. By this, I mean that I had to really think about how I would accomplish my tasks. Since I decided to handle a lot of validation, as well as the login/registration system on the server, I had to spend a to of time debugging the code (as I was adding a fair bit).

**Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging**

a) I estimate that I spent about 5 hours thinking about how on earth I was to accomplish something.

b) I spent maybe 5 solid hours on coding

c) I spent approximately 10 hours debugging and trying to fix my web application.

**Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?**
For this project

**If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?**

If I could go back in time and do things differently, I would not wait as long to ask for help. The time that I spent trying to figure out something on my own was valuable, but it also made me more stressed. When I used additional resources like w3 or a classmate, it was like a veil and lifted, and I could see clearly.
