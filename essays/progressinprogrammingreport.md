My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:

I can confidently say that my programming skills have markedly improved from when I first started class (my skillset was about negligible when I first started). 

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:

I believe that I understand the syntax of different languages such as html, javascript, json, and css, as well as the application of conditional statements, loops, and algorithms(I do not know all of them, but I recognize the patterns and usage of such 

I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions first.

When I first started, I relied heavily on the screencast solutions to complete the WODs. Generally speaking however as I. The last 3 or so WODs had no screencast solution at all (at least when did them) and so I had to just. These took the least amount of tries, but I spent the longest trying to get the programming right on the first try (sometimes upwards of 1-2 hours for the later WODs) and try to fix any errors I encountered instead of starting from the beginning again.

The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.

In all truthfulness, I learned a lot just from reading the material provided before class and trying out little exercises on w3 schools. The Labs acted moreso as supplementary materials that reinforced the knowledge that I had just acquired from reading. The Labs also helped

I feel ready I am ready to work on the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications like Assignment 1).

I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:

These are things that work really well for my learning in this class:
