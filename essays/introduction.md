Growing up I was really involved in Scouting, and came to develop an understanding of how to work with groups of people. The troop I was a part of was really well run, with each individual like a cog in a machine. As I started my first job, I built upon these skills with technology, using greater use of information systems and even some nominal levels of programming in order to communicate and work better with my co-workers and supervisor. Software in this way came to represent a new part of the machine which I had not considered -- the oil you use to make things run smoother. 

I came to realize that understanding these tools we use so extensively in our daily lives is integral to succeding not only in business, but also in life in the 21st century. The urging of my advisor, classmates, and this realization of the role that these information systems play in our daily lives encouraged me to pursue MIS as a degree.
